        <h1>terms of service</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">last updated: jan 14, 2026</p>
        <p>this is a legal agreement. read it. if you use deadhand, you agree to this.</p>
    </header>

    <main>
        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>legal disclaimer:</strong> i am a developer in argentina, not a lawyer. deadhand is a tool i built
            for myself and shared with the world. use it at your own risk. i am not responsible for your money.
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>1. no liability</h2>
            <p>this is the most important part. deadhand, max (the founder), and anyone associated with this project are
                NOT liable for any loss of funds, cryptocurrency, or digital assets. if you lose your seed phrase, if
                the switch triggers early, if the switch doesnt trigger at all, if our servers catch fire... you accept
                that risk.</p>
            <p>limit of liability: $0.00. we are not an insurance company. we are a software project.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. service description</h2>
            <p>deadhand uses shamir's secret sharing (sss) to split your seed phrase. we store one encrypted shard. any
                2 of 3 shards can recover your seed. this is a trustless system by design, but software can have bugs.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. user responsibility</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>you are responsible for keeping shard a safe.</li>
                <li>you are responsible for giving shard b to your beneficiary.</li>
                <li>you are responsible for responding to heartbeat emails.</li>
                <li>you are responsible for verifying that your recovery setup actually works.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. no financial advice</h2>
            <p>i dont give financial or legal advice. talk to a professional if you're worried about inheritance laws or
                taxes. deadhand is a technical tool, not a legal entity.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. privacy</h2>
            <p>we don't want your data. we store your email and an encrypted blob of data (shard c). that's it. we don't
                sell data. we don't track you beyond what's needed for the switch to work.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. termination</h2>
            <p>we can stop this service at any time. if we do, we'll try to give you 30 days notice to recover your
                shards. since we use standard bip-39 and shamir's secret sharing, you are never locked in. you can
                recover your seed using open-source tools (like `ssss-split`) without our servers. we are just a
                convenient interface for math.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. argentina jurisdiction</h2>
            <p>any legal issues will be handled under the laws of argentina. but seriously, let's just be cool.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. architecture guarantee</h2>
            <p>we built deadhand using standard 2-of-3 shamir's secret sharing. mathematically, we only possess shard c.
                we literally cannot access your funds even if we wanted to, or even if a government ordered us to. we
                are not asking for your trust; we are relying on cryptography.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. indemnification</h2>
            <p>you agree to hold max comperatore and deadhand harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable
                attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to your use of the service, your violation of these terms,
                or your violation of any rights of another. in plain english: if you mess up and someone sues us because
                of it, you pay the lawyers.</p>
