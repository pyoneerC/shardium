# Deadhand Launch Hypothesis: Experiment 01

**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Founder:** Max

## 1. The Hypothesis
"Crypto users who currently store seed phrases in Google Drive, screenshots, or 'backwards for security' will trust a raw, human-centered, Argentine-built tool more than corporate apps if it feels authentic and trustless."

## 2. Success Criteria (The "Win")
- **Scale:** Get **100** unique seed-splits (Step 1) in the first 14 days after launch.
- **Conversion:** At least **10%** of those who split their seed also activate the server-side switch (Step 3).
- **Engagement:** At least 3 people write a public post (Twitter/Reddit) mentionaing the "handwritten cards" or the "Mitch quote".

## 3. Failure Criteria (The "Falsify")
- **Hypothesis is False if:** After reaching 1,000 unique visitors, fewer than 20 people use the split tool. 
- **Meaning:** If people don't try it even when it's free, the "Personal/Human" angle didn't overcome the "Basement Hacker" fear.

## 4. Why this matters
If the hypothesis is false, we don't keep polishing the UI. We either pivot the brand (make it look ultra-corporate) or we pivot the product.
