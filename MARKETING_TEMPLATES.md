# 🚀 Marketing Templates for Deadhand

## 1. Email Template for Micro-Influencers

**Subject:** Free Lifetime license - I built something for your audience

---

Hey [NAME],

I'm Max, a developer who's been in crypto since 2017.

I built **Deadhand** - an open-source tool that splits your seed phrase into 3 shards using Shamir's Secret Sharing. Lose one shard? Recover with the other two. Die? Your family inherits automatically.

**Why I'm reaching out:**

I've seen your content on [YouTube/Twitter] about hardware wallets and seed phrase security. Your audience is exactly who this is for.

**The offer:**

- Free Lifetime license ($129 value)
- Full access to source code (MIT license): github.com/pyoneerC/Deadhand
- No strings attached

**All I ask:**

If you like it, mention it. If you don't, tell me why so I can fix it.

**The tech:**
- Client-side encryption only (your seed never leaves your browser)
- Real Shamir's Secret Sharing (not some fake split)
- Dead man's switch (beneficiary gets Shard C if you don't respond to check-ins)
- Open source - you can audit every line

Here's a 20-second demo: [LINK TO DEMO VIDEO]

Would love to hear your thoughts.

## 2. Twitter Thread (Launch Announcement)

**Tweet 1:**
```
I built Deadhand because I was terrified of losing my seed phrase.

The problem:
• Lose your seed = lose everything
• Die = your family loses everything
• Paper backup? House fire = gone

The solution: Shamir's Secret Sharing

Here's how it works 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Deadhand splits your seed into 3 shards:

• Shard A → You keep (password manager)
• Shard B → Your heir keeps (USB drive)
• Shard C → Encrypted on our servers

Any 2 shards can recover your seed.
But 1 shard alone? Completely useless.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
The Dead Man's Switch:

Every 90 days, we email you.
If you don't respond → Shard C goes to your beneficiary.

They combine it with Shard B (which you gave them).
Your family inherits your crypto. Automatically.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Why is this safer than a Ledger?

Ledger protects you from hackers.
It doesn't protect you from:
• Losing the paper backup
• House fires
• Dying without telling anyone

Deadhand eliminates single points of failure.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
The code is 100% open source (MIT license).

Client-side encryption only.
Your seed phrase never touches our servers.
Audit it yourself: github.com/pyoneerC/Deadhand

LAUNCH OFFER:

First 100 users get Lifetime for $49 (normally $129).

10X Refund Guarantee:
If you can't recover your seed, I'll personally refund 10x your purchase.

## 3. Reddit Post Template (r/CryptoCurrency, r/Bitcoin)

**Title:** I built an open-source tool to split your seed phrase after almost losing mine

---

Hey r/CryptoCurrency,

Last year I almost lost access to ~$50k in crypto because I couldn't find my seed phrase backup. That scared the shit out of me.

So I built **Deadhand**.

**What it does:**
- Splits your seed phrase into 3 "shards" using Shamir's Secret Sharing
- Any 2 shards can recover your original seed
- But 1 shard alone reveals nothing (not even a hint)
- Includes a "dead man's switch" - if you die, Shard C goes to your beneficiary

**The tech (for skeptics):**
- 100% client-side encryption (your seed never leaves your browser)
- Open source, MIT license: [github link]
- Real Shamir's Secret Sharing (not just splitting the words in half)

**Why not just use a Ledger?**
Ledger protects you from hackers. It doesn't protect you from losing the paper backup, house fires, or dying without telling anyone your seed.

**Free self-hosted option:**
Don't trust me? Clone the repo and run it yourself. It's open source.

**Demo:** [20-second video showing the flow]

Happy to answer any technical questions. I'm the solo dev.

## 4. Comparison Tweet (Deadhand vs Ledger Recover)

```
Ledger Recover: Send your encrypted seed to 3 third parties. Trust them.

Deadhand: Split your seed locally. You control all shards. Open source.

Ledger: $10/month forever
Deadhand: $49 once (or free self-hosted)

Ledger: Closed source
Deadhand: MIT license, audit it yourself

Choose wisely.
